        <p>This post is about the what the rank-nullity theorem, a rather basic and fundamental result in linear algebra, really means.</p>
<p>First, I will state a result about vector spaces from which one could prove the rank-nullity theorem:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 1</strong>: every short exact sequence of vector spaces splits.</p>
<p>This looks nothing like the rank-nullity theorem! But first we can look at how this implies rank-nullity. A short exact sequence is just a sequence <span class="math display">\[0 \rightarrow U \xrightarrow{f} V \xrightarrow{g} W \rightarrow 0\]</span> of vector spaces, where <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{im} \ f = \ker g\)</span> (hence the name “exact”).</p>
<p>This sequence is split when <span class="math inline">\(V \cong U \oplus W\)</span>. A short exact sequence is interesting, because it tells us how <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is built from <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>: if the exact sequence is split, then we have the most obvious building method, which make things much easier. Another way to think about this is by the splitting lemma:</p>
<p><strong>Lemma</strong> (splitting lemma): for a short exact sequence <span class="math display">\[0 \rightarrow L \xrightarrow{f} M \xrightarrow{g} N \rightarrow 0\]</span> of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-modules, where <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is any ring, the following are equivalent:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is left-invertible, i.e. there is a morphism <span class="math inline">\(h : B \rightarrow A\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(h \circ f = \mathrm{id}_A\)</span>;</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is right-invertible;</li>
<li>the sequence is split, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(M \cong L \oplus N\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I won’t repeat the proof here, because it could be found in any graduate algebra text. On a side note, this facts actually holds over any abelian category, not just <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Mod} R\)</span>.</p>
<p>The fact that every short exact sequence of vector spaces splits is rooted in a much simpler fact: any vector space has a basis. We can use this fact to prove theorem 1:</p>
<p><strong>Proof of Theorem 1</strong>: let <span class="math inline">\(\{w_i\}\)</span> be a basis of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is necessarily surjective (why?), we can find a set <span class="math inline">\(\{v_i\} \subseteq V\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f(v_i) = w_i\)</span>. Then we define a function <span class="math inline">\(h : W \rightarrow V\)</span> by setting <span class="math inline">\(h(w_i) = v_i\)</span>. This is well-defined because a linear map is determined by its action on basis elements. <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is a right inverse to <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, so by the splitting lemma this short exact sequence is split.</p>
<p><strong>Proof of rank-nullity</strong>: at this point, the rank-nullity theorem is almost trivial. Simply consider the short exact sequence: <span class="math display">\[0 \rightarrow \ker f \hookrightarrow V \twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{im} \ f \rightarrow 0\]</span> and observe that, since the sequence is split, <span class="math inline">\(V \cong \ker f \oplus \mathrm{im} \ f\)</span>. Taking dimension on both sides yields the rank-nullity theorem.</p>
<p>In fact, we have proven a statement that is more general than the rank-nullity theorem! When <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is infinite-dimensional, the rank-nullity theorem fails, but <span class="math inline">\(V \cong \ker f \oplus \mathrm{im} \ f\)</span> still holds.</p>
<p>This, again, tells us one important fact about vector spaces: that linear maps contain all the information we need to study a space. This is, again, due to the fact that every vector space has a basis, i.e. a generating set that is linearly independent! This is what makes vector spaces so much simpler than general modules.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the very familiar first isomorphism theorem also implies rank-nullity:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 2</strong> (the first isomorphism theorem): let <span class="math inline">\(M, N\)</span> be modules over a base ring, and <span class="math inline">\(f : M \rightarrow N\)</span> a linear map. Then <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{im} \ f \cong M/\ker f\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is slightly weaker than Theorem 1, but enough to prove rank-nullity:</p>
<p><strong>Alternate proof</strong>: by the first isomorphism theorem, we know that <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{im} \ f \cong V/ \ker f\)</span>. Taking the dimension on both sides yields <span class="math inline">\(\dim \mathrm{im} \ f = \dim V - \dim \ker f\)</span>.</p>
<p>This reiterates the essence of rank-nullity: the rank-nullity theorem is just the first isomorphism theorem in disguise, telling us that a linear map divides the information about a vector space into two complementary parts!</p>
